# A Template for C/C++ Premake5 Projects [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/johnratius/premake5_template_cpp.svg)](https://github.com/johnratius/premake5_template_cpp/blob/master/LICENSE)
This is my custom Premake5 template for all of my C++ projects. This currently only supports Windows OS.

### Features of this template
This template has some useful Windows batch scripts to help you get started quicker:

* A script to rename your project so you don't have to manually change the name everywhere
* A configurable build script that can be called in different ways
* A configurable clean script to clean after a project build

### Yet to be implemented

* Hopefully in the future I will be able to make this cross-platform

Refer to the LICENSE for usage terms.
